No setup required! You only need an SSL certificate, and this plugin will do the rest.

== Description ==
The really simple ssl plugin automatically detects your settings and configures your website.
To keep it lightweight, the options are kept to a minimum. The entire site will move to SSL.

= Three simple steps for setup: =
* Get an SSL certificate (can't do that for you, sorry).
* Activate this plugin
* Enable SSL with one click

Aways backup before you go! If you do not have a sound backup policy, start having one! For a snapshot, install duplicator.

= Love Really Simple SSL? =
Hopefully this plugin save you some hours of work. If you want to support the continuing development of this plugin, you might consider buying the [premium](https://www.really-simple-ssl.com/pro/), which includes
some cool features like the mixed content scan, the option to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security and more detailed feedback on the configuration page.

= What does the plugin actually do =
* The plugin handles most issues that Wordpress has with ssl, like the much discussed loadbalancer issue, or when there are no server variables set at all.
* All incoming requests are redirected to https. If possible with .htaccess, or else with javascript.
* The site url and home url are changed to https.
* Your insecure content is fixed by replacing all http:// urls with https://, except hyperlinks to other domains. Dynamically, so no database changes are made (except for the siteurl and homeurl).

= Like to have this plugin in your language? =
Translations can be added very easily [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/really-simple-ssl). If you do, I can get you added as translation editor to approve the translations.

== Installation ==
To install this plugin:

1. Make a backup!
2. Install your ssl certificate
3. Download the plugin
4. Upload the plugin to the wp-content/plugins directory,
5. Go to “plugins” in your wordpress admin, then click activate.
6. You will get redirected to the login screen. If not, go to the login screen and log on.

= Uninstalling =
In some cases it happens that you cannot access your admin anymore, which would prevent your from uninstalling. The
plugin is shipped with a simple method to uninstall:

1. In the wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl folder, rename the file "force-deactivate.txt" to "force-deactivate.php".
2. In your browser, go to http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl/force-deactivate.php (replace yourdomain.com with your own domain).
Please remember to use http://, and not https://!

The plugin is now deactivated and all changes were removed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Knowledge base =
For more detailed explanations and documentation on redirect loops, deactivating, mixed content, errors, and so on, please search the [documentation](https://www.really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/)

= Does the mixed content fixer make my site slower? =
On a site where the source consists of about 60.000 characters, the delay caused by the mixed content fixer is about 0.00188 seconds. If this is too much for you, fix the mixed content manually and deactivate it in the settings.

= Mixed content issues =
Most mixed content issues are caused by urls in css or js files.
For detailed instructions on how to find mixed content read this [article](https://really-simple-ssl.com/knowledge-base/how-to-track-down-mixed-content-or-insecure-content/).

= Redirect loop issues =
* If you are experiencing redirect loops on your site, you might want to try disabling the .htaccess:

1. Remove this plugins's rules from your .htaccess.
2. Add to your wp-config.php:
define( 'RLRSSSL_DO_NOT_EDIT_HTACCESS', TRUE);

= How to uninstall when website/backend is not accessible =
Though this plugin is extensively tested, this can still happen. However, this is very easy to fix (you'll need ftp access):

1. In the wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl folder, rename the file "force-deactivate.txt" to "force-deactivate.php".
2. In your browser, go to www.yourdomain.com/wp-content/plugins/really-simple-ssl/force-deactivate.php (replace yourdomain.com with your own domain).
Please take care to use http://, and not https://. On a domain without certificate, the deactivate won't load on https.

The plugin is now deactivated and all changes were removed.

= Is the plugin suitable for wordpress multisite? =
Yes, the plugin is wpmu ready.
You can activate ssl per site on subdomain and domain mapping installs. On subfolder installs networkwide activation is encouraged (domain.com/site1).

== Upgrade notice ==
On settings page load, the .htaccess file is no rewritten. If you have made .htaccess customizations to the RSSSL block and have not blocked the plugin from editing it, do so before upgrading.
Always back up before any upgrade. Especially .htaccess, wp-config.php and the plugin folder. This way you can easily roll back.

== Screenshots ==
1. After activation, if SSL was detected, you can enable SSL.
2. View your configuration on the settings page
